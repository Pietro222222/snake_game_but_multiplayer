# Game
its just a multiplayer snake game, but written in rust

# WHY?

i wrote a snake game, but i thought it was a good idea to let my brother play it, so i decided to implement multiplayer


# why a different repo 

because im too lazy to implement options such as --enable-multiplayer so theyre different binaries

# Controls 

change the direction of the snake with the arrow keys
<br>
quit with the `q`
<br>
